# Saphpi
Saphpi, pronounced as ‘sapi’, is a robust web application framework that adheres to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. Drawing inspiration from a multitude of popular frameworks, Saphpi is engineered to be explicit and free from dependencies, with an open core at its heart.

## Features

- **Open Core Philosophy**: Saphpi embraces the open core philosophy, providing essential functionality out-of-the-box while allowing developers to extend and customize the framework to suit their specific needs.

- **Dependency-Free**: Saphpi is engineered to be free from external dependencies, reducing potential conflicts and simplifying the development process.
